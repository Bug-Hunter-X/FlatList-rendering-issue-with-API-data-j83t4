# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using FlatList in React Native to render data fetched from an API.  The bug involves the FlatList either failing to render the data correctly or not rendering at all, despite receiving valid data from the API.

The solution involves checking for network errors and handling them appropriately, ensuring the data structure is suitable for FlatList, and correctly using keys for list items.  Additionally, it shows how to handle loading and error states using state variables and conditional rendering.
